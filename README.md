# TAS_On_Azure
***updated to reflect latest az cli breaking changes, sanity checks, and a few other things***
This is a quick way to get Opsmanager deployed in Azure. The script is making the following assumptions: 

1) You are a CE on either East or West coast with access to the GSS Azure subscription (VMware account). If you don't have access to this subscription please request it in the labs channel.
2) You are using a Mac.
3) You have the Brew package manager.
4) You have the uaac cli installed.

Make sure that when it asks you to log in to Azure you use your VMware credentials!
