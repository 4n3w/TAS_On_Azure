# TAS_On_Azure
 
This is a quick way to get Opsmanager deployed in Azure. The script is making many assumptions and it was specifically made for CE's in East or West coast. If you need to customize stuff you might want to go a different route.

Prerequisites:

- Brew (to install az cli)
- uaac cli

Make sure when it asks you to log in to Azure you use the Pivotal subscription (pivotal.io)!
